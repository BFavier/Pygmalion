Pygmalion in the greek mythologie is a sculptor that fell in love with one of his creations. In the myth, Aphrodite gives life to Galatea, the sculpture he fell in love with. This package is a python machine learning library that implements models for some common machine learning tasks. Everything that you need to give a mind of their own to inanimate silicon-based objects that are computers.

# Installing pygmalion

pygmalion can be installed through pip.

~~~
python -m pip install pygmalion
~~~

# Fast prototyping of models with pygmalion

Architectures for several common machine learning tasks (regression, image classification, machine translation ...) are implemented in this package.

The inputs and outputs of the models are common python objects (such as numpy array and pandas dataframes).

In this section we are going to see how to load a dataset, train a model, display some metrics, and save a model.

~~~python
>>> import pygmalion as ml
>>> import pygmalion.neural_networks as nn
>>> import pandas as pd
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
~~~

You can download a dataset and split it with the **split** function.

~~~python
>>> ml.datasets.boston_housing("./")
>>> df = pd.read_csv("./boston_housing.csv")
>>> df_train, df_val, df_test = ml.utilities.split(df, weights=(0.8, 0.1, 0.1))
~~~

Creating and training a model takes few lines of code.

~~~python
>>> inputs, target = [c for c in df.columns if c != "medv"], "medv"
>>> model = nn.DenseRegressor(inputs, target, hidden_layers=[32, 32])
>>> x_train, y_train = model.data_to_tensor(df_train[inputs], df_train[target])
>>> x_val, y_val = model.data_to_tensor(df_val[inputs], df_val[target])
>>> history = model.fit((x_train, y_train), (x_val, y_val), n_steps=1000, patience=100, learning_rate=1.0E-3)
~~~

Some usefull metrics can easily be evaluated.

For a regressor model, the available metrics are [**MSE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error), [**RMSE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation), [**R2**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_determination), and the correlation between target and prediction can be visualized with the **plot_fitting** function.

~~~python
>>> f, ax = plt.subplots()
>>> ml.utilities.plot_fitting(df_train[target], model.predict(df_train), ax=ax, label="training")
>>> ml.utilities.plot_fitting(df_val[target], model.predict(df_val), ax=ax, label="validation")
>>> ml.utilities.plot_fitting(df_test[target], model.predict(df_test), ax=ax, label="testing", color="C3")
>>> R2 = ml.utilities.R2(model.predict(df_test), df_test[target])
>>> ax.set_title(f"R²={R2:.3g}")
>>> ax.set_xlabel("target")
>>> ax.set_ylabel("predicted")
>>> plt.show()
~~~

For a classifier model you can evaluate the [**accuracy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification), and display the confusion matrix.

~~~python
>>> ml.datasets.iris("./")
>>> df = pd.read_csv("./iris.csv")
>>> df_train, df_val, df_test = ml.utilities.split(df, weights=(0.7, 0.2, 0.1))
>>> inputs, target = [c for c in df.columns if c != "variety"], "variety"
>>> classes = df[target].unique()
>>> model = nn.DenseClassifier(inputs, target, classes, hidden_layers=[8, 8, 8])
>>> train_data = model.data_to_tensor(df_train[inputs], df_train[target])
>>> val_data = model.data_to_tensor(df_train[inputs], df_train[target])
>>> model.fit(train_data, val_data, n_steps=1000, patience=100)
>>> f, ax = plt.subplots()
>>> y_test, y_pred = df_test[target], model.predict(df_test)
>>> ml.utilities.plot_matrix(ml.utilities.confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred, classes=classes), ax=ax, cmap="Greens", write_values=True, format=".2%")
>>> acc = ml.utilities.accuracy(y_pred, y_test)
>>> ax.set_title(f"Accuracy: {acc:.2%}")
>>> plt.tight_layout()
>>> plt.show()
~~~

All the models can be saved directly to the disk with the **save** method.
A model saved on the disk can then be loaded back with the **load_model** function.

~~~python
>>> model.save("./model.pth")
>>> model = ml.utilities.load_model("./model.pth")
~~~

# Implemented models

For examples of model training see the **samples** folder in the [github page](https://github.com/BFavier/Pygmalion).

## Neural networks

The neural networks are implemented in pytorch under the hood.
Each model is a pytorch **Module**. The fit method of neural networks returns a train loss, validation loss, gradient scale history that can be ploted with the **plot_loss** functions.

~~~python
>>> train_losses, val_losses, grad, best_step = model.fit(...)
>>> ml.utilities.plot_losses(train_losses, val_losses, grad, best_step)
~~~

### **DenseRegressor**

A DenseRegressor (or multi layer perceptron regressor) predicts a scalar value given an input of several variables. An example of DenseRegressor training was demonstrated in a previous section.

### **DenseClassifier**

A DenseClassifier (or multi layer perceptron classifier) predicts a str class value given an input of several variables. An example of DenseClassifier training was presented in a previous section.

### **ProbabilityDistribution**

A ProbabilityDistribution is a multilayer perceptron used to learn the CDF (Cumulated Distribution Function) of tabular data in an unsupervised fashion. Countrary to gaussian mixture models it's PDF (Probability Density Function) is not constrained to beeing positive which makes it a degenerate distribution function. This model is usefull for anomaly detection, or training domain learning.
